                <p>All participants after being checked for the bot constraints will be allowed to let their bots
trace the line in the arena. The arena would have several turns which the bot has to manoeuvre 
properly to reach the destination. You are allowed 3 manual interventions with each one costing you 
a time penalty. The 4th time drops you out of the game. The top teams which finish the track with the 
least amount of time are deemed winners and receive exciting prizes.</p>
